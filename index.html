    <hi>Untitled Git Project!</hi>
    <p>Hello, and welcome to the project where the content doesn't matter. That's right! The content is like
    points on Whose Line is it Anyway, or an ex-Hollwood exec's open apology letters. Ir-elephant! The _main_ purpose
    is to practice collaborating with Git. This project has been introduced with a super basic html shell, simply
    to give us something to work with. From here...do your worst!</p>
    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>This project is a living item, so the subject and tone can take on any shape!</li>
      <li>Adorable pictures encouraged</li>
      <li>Nothing pornographic (*must be suitable for work*)</li>
    </ul>
  </body>
